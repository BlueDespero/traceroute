# Traceroute

Reimplementation of a traceroute function, allowing the user to monitor the route of the packages between their machine and the destination server. I implemented it to get better understanding of networking.

# Usage
After creating the executable with the makefile provided, you can pass an IP address as an argument. You will recieve a printout of the IP addresses visited on the way to the provided destination.
